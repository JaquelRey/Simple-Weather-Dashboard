## Details  
### Features  
Features required for this project were dynamically updated HTML and CSS  
### Technologies  
jQuery was used, because I guess that's what I started with months ago. Bulma is used for the styling. I also used Geocode's API to fetch latitude and longitude of user queries.  
## Contributing  
I need to refactor this code- it's old and certainly not to par with my current standard. That being said, I'm not taking feedback until I do so.
